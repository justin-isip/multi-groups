# Multi-group analysis

This repository is an attempt to develop my skills in version control for one of the potential chapters in my PhD (which is ongoing) - wish me luck!

I deal mostly with the [PREDICTS](https://www.nhm.ac.uk/our-science/our-work/biodiversity/predicts.html) database which looks at how terrestrial biodiversity responds to land use change and intensification. This chapter is interested in studies within PREDICTS that sample multiple insect orders within the same study. The idea being that we have a much tighter, controlled comparsion when we compare taxa that have been sampled under the same conditions (i.e. within the same studies). Previous research using the PREDICTS database has compared responses of groups of organisms to land-use change and intensification without controlling for the variation between studies. This research attempts to address this issue.
