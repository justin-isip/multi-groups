Lepidoptera,,Butterflies,Y,N,N,N,N,N,UK,Y,N,N,N,N,N,"Active visual surveys, such as transect walks and hand netting;", ,"Visual assessments can be conducted on pollard walk transects for butterflies and day-flying moths. These are measured by amount of transects per area rather than a minimum size of an area. The UKBMS states that transects are typically 1km long, but this doesn't account for small sites or very large sites in a simple manner. In my experience, although dependent on the character/accessibility of the area questioned, a transect of 1k m in length is enough to capture the maximum species occupancy at a 3-5 ha site. There are further caveats to transect design beyond area though, including relative homogeneity of  a site. For example, a large species-poor grassland might not need the same survey effort as an equally sized structurally complex woodland with well managed rides, glades, shaded areas etc. Certainly under representing a site through poor transect to area ratio can potentially impact accuracy in abundance and diversity measurements, particularly where structure, habitat types and general character is diverse. 
","Butterfly transect sampling season spans April to the end of September, with at least 26 visits to a site's transect in that period under specific weather conditions. This captures as much of each season as possible, including the June 'lull'. The amount of years sampled depends on the context of the study, but even relative comparisons between areas should aim to capture at least one of each season for a single year at the bare minimum. When comparing phenology, 3 - 5 + years could be considered the minimum to make any solid conclusions and account for any exceptional years such as the summer heatwave of 2022. 

If the question refers to how long an individual survey takes, butterfly pollard walk transects typically take 20+ minutes per 1km transect depending on the terrain. Other effective visual surveys include the 15 minute walk, but this is contextual depending on the area being surveyed and should supplement pollard walks, not replace them, and would be conducted as the same frequency as the pollard walk.",

For suction sampling, I would take a series of 10 sub-samples equivalent to 0.2m2, which would constitute a single sample.

If a treatment comparison was being made, then the number of samples might be 3 or 5 per replicate treatment.

Gardiner T (2010) Hedgerow species richness influences the presence of Orthoptera and Dermaptera along green lanes in Essex, U.K. Entomologist’s Gazette 61: 53–64.

acoustic monitoring and visual surveys (Orthoptera):  A 1-m wide × 400-m long transect was established in fields in recent study. Transects were arranged in a W shape (each arm 100 m) to ensure even coverage of each field and avoid any edge habitat effects. Each transect was walked at a slow, strolling pace (2 km/hr) on 3 occasions from May–August 2021. Adult individuals of all Orthoptera species along all transects were recorded acoustically and visually to determine assemblage composition and species diversity and richness. Nymphs flushed from a 1-m wide band in front of the observer were recorded along all transects. As it is difficult to distinguish between species in the early instars (though not impossible, see Thommen 2021), numbers for nymphs of all species were lumped together for recording purposes. The surveys were undertaken in vegetation sufficiently short (<50 cm) to minimize the possibility of overlooking nymphs in tall grass or non-stridulating species such as groundhoppers (Tetrigidae). With practice, it was relatively easy to ascertain the species of adults without capture (Gardiner and Hill 2006), although some species, such as long-winged conehead Conocephalus fuscus and Roesel’s bushcricket Roeseliana roeselii, are significantly under-recorded using visual transects. A dual visual and acoustic monitoring method has been used by Weiss et al. (2013) to ensure complete coverage of the orthopteran fauna of sites. In the current study, a stridulation monitoring technique was used to record adult males of species that stridulated along the transects at the same time as visual monitoring by flushing. Stridulation monitoring has been used to record cryptic species in Essex and has been found to be effective compared to visual sighting transects and pitfall traps. Bat detectors were not required in the current study as the surveyor was able to reliably detect stridulating males up to 20 m away either side of the transect. The weather conditions on survey days were favourable for insect activity, being largely sunny and warm (>17°C).

visual surveys (Hymenoptera)

Bumblebee monitoring: In sea wall grasslands, 100 m long x 6 m wide transects were established. The methodology for surveying bumblebees followed that of Carvell et al. (2007). Surveys were undertaken between 10:00 and 17:00 h, when weather conditions conformed to the
following criteria for the UK Butterfly Monitoring Scheme: 1) transects were not walked when the temperature is below 13°C; 2) between 13-17 °C, a transect could be walked providing there is at least 60% sun; 3) above 17 °C, a transect could be walked in any conditions, providing it is not raining; 4) when wind speeds are above 5 on the Beaufort scale, transects were not walked (Pollard & Yates 1993).
